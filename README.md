#  Iris Dataset Analysis

## 📄 Description

This project demonstrates **data analysis and visualization** using the classic **Iris dataset**. It covers **data loading, cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualizations** using **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**. The project provides a clear workflow for beginners to understand data exploration and plotting in Python.

## 📁 Project Folder Structure

```
Iris_Analysis_Project/
│── README.md
│── analysis.ipynb
│── requirements.txt
│── data/
    │── iris.csv
```

* `analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with data loading, analysis, and visualizations.
* `requirements.txt` – List of Python libraries required.
* `data/iris.csv` – CSV file containing the Iris dataset.
* `README.md` – This file.

---

## ⚡ Features

* Load the Iris dataset with proper error handling.
* Handle duplicate headers and missing values.
* Perform basic statistical analysis (mean, summary statistics).
* Group data by species and calculate aggregated metrics.
* Visualizations including:

  * Line chart of sepal length
  * Bar chart of average petal length per species
  * Histogram of sepal width
  * Scatter plot of sepal length vs petal length with species differentiation

---

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
2. Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open `analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.

## 📊 Example Visualizations

* **Line chart**: Sepal length across samples
* **Bar chart**: Average petal length per species
* **Histogram**: Distribution of sepal width
* **Scatter plot**: Sepal length vs Petal length colored by species

---

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* `pandas`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Notes

* The notebook automatically skips repeated header lines and handles missing values.
* Visualizations are designed for clear interpretation of the Iris dataset.
* Modify the dataset path in the notebook if the CSV is located elsewhere.
